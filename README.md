# A Digital Pocket Diary.

I created this Little Digital pocket diary for My first year Mini project at the university. It reuires high level computer science knowledge so please don't disturb me by constantly asking how did I made this.

Feel free to suggest further improvements and perhaps we could later turn this into a product and become millionaire some day.
