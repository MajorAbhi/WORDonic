ðŸ“• WORDonic - A Digital Pocket Diary.

I created this Little Digital pocket diary for My first year Mini project at the university.
Simply write anything and it will save it as .txt file with the present date as the file name.
You can even read the previously written diary.

Feel free to suggest further improvements.
A Shoutout to stackoverflow for the help.
